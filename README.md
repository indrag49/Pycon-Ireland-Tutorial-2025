## This is the repository for my Pycon Ireland 2025 tutorial "[Time series analysis for coupled neurons.](https://python.ie/pycon-2025/schedule/)"
- Launch the notebook in [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/indrag49/Pycon-Ireland-Tutorial-2025/HEAD?filepath=PyCon%20Ireland%20Tutorial%20(2025).ipynb).
- You can also choose to run it on your local machine. (Ensure you have all the necessary packages installed!)
- Note that running the notebook from Binder might be comparatively slower than running it on your own local machine. Does not make much of a difference though!
- A corresponding Shiny app can be found [here](https://indrag49.shinyapps.io/TimeSeriesNeuronR/). This is a work in progress.

## This is the repository for my Pycon Ireland 2025 tutorial "[Time series analysis for coupled neurons.](https://python.ie/pycon-2025/schedule/)"
- Access the NBviewer from [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/indrag49/Pycon-Ireland-Tutorial-2025/blob/main/PyCon%20Ireland%20Tutorial%20%282025%29.ipynb). Then click on the binder logo to run the interactive notebooks. 
- You can also choose to run it on your local machine. (Ensure you have all the necessary packages installed!)
- Note that running the notebook from Binder might be comparatively slower than running it on your own local machine. Does not make much of a difference though!
- A corresponding Shiny app can be found [here](https://indrag49.shinyapps.io/TimeSeriesNeuronR/). This is a work in progress.
